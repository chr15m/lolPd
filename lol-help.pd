#X text 7 8 O! is a minimalist domain-specific language for doing simple
programmatic tasks and list-comprehensions in Pure Data. It exists
to try and prevent RSI. Internally \, O creates vertical stacks of
Pd objects connected by a single pipeline and data runs as usual from
top to bottom.;
#X text 9 127 range = output a range of numbers using [until] and an
internal counter \; tee X = send value to X as well as passing it through
\; concat X = concatenate from X onto incoming values \; choose N [M]
= choose the Nth to Mth values in a list \; gather [N] = gather incoming
values into a list \, N at a time is optional \; . X = when anthing
is received on X \, output whatever was last input \;, f 74;
#X text 9 94 In addition to standard Pd objects \, you can also insert
the following functions into a pipeline:;
#X obj 18 250 lol tee value \; range 10 \; cat value \; expr $f1 +
$f2 \;;
#X obj 138 228 lol tee done \; range 20 \; tee index \; bng \; random
